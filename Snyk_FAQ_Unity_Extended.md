## üß™ Running Snyk **Without Code Changes**

You can add Snyk coverage from the **platform/pipeline layer** without editing application code:

1. **Connect Repos in Snyk (UI)**  
   - In Snyk ‚Üí **Integrations ‚Üí Source Control ‚Üí GitHub (Enterprise)**  
   - Install the **Snyk GitHub App** (GHEC) or configure **GHES**.  
   - Select repos to import. Snyk will discover **manifests/lockfiles** and create **Projects**.

2. **Pipeline (CI) Steps**  
   - Add a CI job to run Snyk **without modifying code**:  
     ```bash
     npm i -g snyk
     snyk auth  # Uses SNYK_TOKEN env var in CI
     snyk test          # SCA against manifests
     snyk code test     # SAST (needs repo source, but no code edits)
     snyk iac test      # IaC files
     snyk monitor       # Save snapshot to dashboard for trending
     ```

3. **Container Image Scans** (no code changes)  
   ```bash
   snyk container test your.registry/app:tag
   snyk container monitor your.registry/app:tag
   ```

4. **IaC Scans** (no code changes)  
   ```bash
   snyk iac test ./infra/
   snyk iac test ./k8s/ --report
   ```

5. **Org‚Äëlevel Policies (no repo edits)**  
   - Prefer **org policies** (severity/licensing) instead of `.snyk` policy files to avoid code changes.  
   - Configure **fail‚Äëthe‚Äëbuild** behavior in CI via exit codes or Snyk Action inputs.

---

## üìà Impact on **SCA** and **SAST** Features (no code changes)

- **SCA (Dependencies)**  
  - ‚úÖ Works fully by scanning **manifests + lockfiles** (e.g., `pom.xml`, `package-lock.json`, `requirements.txt`).  
  - No code edits required. Includes reachable‚Äëpath analysis where supported.

- **SAST (Snyk Code)**  
  - ‚úÖ No code edits required, but **source code must be present** in the repo/CI workspace.  
  - Results quality depends on having complete code; monorepos supported.  
  - PR checks/inline annotations available with GitHub integration.

- **Container & IaC**  
  - ‚úÖ 100% feasible with no code edits; runs on artifacts/configs produced by CI or stored in repo.

---

## üß© Option 1: Native **Snyk + GitHub Enterprise** Integration (Recommended)

### A) **GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC)** ‚Äì easiest path
1. In Snyk, navigate to **Integrations ‚Üí Source Control ‚Üí GitHub** (Enterprise Cloud).  
2. **Install the Snyk GitHub App** to your Enterprise org.  
3. **Select repositories** (or allow org‚Äëwide).  
4. Snyk imports repos ‚Üí creates **Projects** (SCA, SAST, IaC, Container where applicable).  
5. Enable **PR Checks** (branch protection optional) so findings appear inline in PRs.  
6. Configure **org policies** (severity thresholds, license policies).  
7. Set **notifications** (email/Slack) and **ticketing** (Jira/ServiceNow) rules.  
8. Add **tags** at import or via API to support dashboards and SLA views.  

**Branch Protection Example (GitHub)**  
- Require status checks to pass: `snyk (SCA)`, `snyk-code (SAST)`  
- Dismiss stale approvals when new commits are pushed.  
- Require linear history or signed commits (optional, per policy).

### B) **GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES)** ‚Äì if self‚Äëhosted
- Choose **Direct Integration** (open firewall for Snyk SaaS to reach GHES API) **or** deploy **[Snyk Broker](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/snyk-broker)** as a secure proxy.  
- Steps mirror GHEC once connectivity is established.  
- Confirm API endpoint (e.g., `https://github.company.com/api/v3`) and install the Snyk App.

---

## üß™ Option 2: Pipeline‚ÄëBased Scanning with **Snyk CLI** (no direct integration)

Use the CLI inside your CI system (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Azure DevOps, GitLab CI, etc.).

### GitHub Actions ‚Äì **Language‚Äëagnostic** template
```yaml
name: Snyk Scan
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [ "main", "release/*" ]

jobs:
  snyk:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node (for CLI)
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install Snyk
        run: npm i -g snyk

      - name: Auth
        run: snyk auth
        env:
          SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}

      - name: SCA (Dependencies)
        run: snyk test --all-projects --severity-threshold=high

      - name: SAST (Snyk Code)
        run: snyk code test --severity-threshold=high

      - name: IaC
        run: snyk iac test ./infra --report || true  # non-blocking example

      - name: Container (if image available)
        run: |
          docker pull your.registry/app:tag
          snyk container test your.registry/app:tag --severity-threshold=high

      - name: Monitor (save snapshot to dashboard)
        run: snyk monitor --all-projects
```

### Maven/Gradle/Node/Python ‚Äì examples
```bash
# Maven
snyk test --maven
# Gradle
snyk test --all-sub-projects
# Node
snyk test --yarn-workspaces --detection-depth=4
# Python
snyk test --file=requirements.txt --package-manager=pip
```

**Build Blocking**  
- Use `--severity-threshold=high` to fail builds on High/Critical only.  
- Or allow pass with `|| true` for non‚Äëblocking jobs in early rollout phases.

   - Choose repos to monitor (or all).  
   - Snyk creates **Projects** per manifest/source.  
   - Optional: apply **tags** on import (e.g., `team:platform`, `app:unity`, `env:prod`).

4. **Enable PR Checks & Policies**  
   - In GitHub, add **required status checks** to branch protection.  
   - In Snyk, set **severity/licensing policies** at org level.  
   - Decide **blocking vs advisory** for initial rollout.

5. **Notifications & Ticketing**  
   - Configure **email/Slack** notifications for new vulns or regressions.  
   - Set **Jira/ServiceNow** automation (High/Critical ‚Üí create ticket).  
   - Define SLAs (e.g., Critical: 7 days; High: 30 days).

6. **Reporting & Cadence**  
   - Schedule **weekly digest** to security + engineering leads (___).

## üè∑Ô∏è Tagging & Naming Recommendations

- **Tags**: `team:<name>`, `app:<name>`, `env:<dev|qa|prod>`, `service:<svc>`, `branch:<main|release/*>`  
- **Use cases**: Filter dashboards, route notifications, and enforce SLAs by team/app/env.

---

## üì§ Example: Weekly Reporting via CLI (JSON export)

```bash
# Export Snyk org issues as JSON (example; requires SNYK_TOKEN, org id)
snyk test --all-projects --json > snyk-findings.json
# Or use Snyk API for richer exports (issues, projects, tags) to feed BI dashboards.
```

> Note: Prefer built‚Äëin Snyk email schedules and dashboard views where possible; use API/CLI exports for custom BI.
